# Serverless computing: Architecture and Applications  
## Overview 
This repository contains the documentation for the research paper on serverless computing
## ABSTRACT
This research paper explores serverless computing, where cloud providers manage servers, freeing developers. It analyzes Function as a Service (FaaS) and Backend as a Service (BaaS) paradigms, comparing their benefits and use cases. Advantages like reduced complexity and cost-effectiveness are discussed, alongside challenges such as security and vendor lock-in. The study aims to propose solutions for effective deployment and management of serverless architectures.
## Objective:
1. To explore and analyze various aspects of serverless computing, focusing on its architectural principles and practical applications. 
2. To Understand and Explore the fundamental components of Serverless Architecture including its principles, and Identify scalability benefits. 
3. To Examine current trends and review and synthesize existing literature.
## Problem/ Challenges
- **Cold Start Latency:** Investigate methods to mitigate the cold start latency problem in serverless computing, where the delay in starting a function instance can impact application responsiveness and user experience.

- **Resource Allocation and Scaling:** Address the challenge of efficiently allocating and scaling resources in serverless environments to meet varying workload demands while minimizing costs and maximizing performance.

- **Concurrency and Scalability:** Explore techniques for managing concurrency and scalability challenges in serverless platforms, including optimizing resource utilization and handling bursts of incoming requests.
  
## Focus of our Research
- **Cost-Efficient Auto-Scaling:** Develop algorithms or strategies to optimize auto-scaling mechanisms in serverless platforms to minimize costs while maintaining performance.
- **Fine-Grained Resource Allocation:** Investigate methods for more granular allocation of resources in serverless environments to better match the needs of individual functions or tasks, thus improving resource utilization.
- **Cold Start Mitigation Techniques:** Explore various techniques to reduce cold start latency in serverless functions, such as pre-warming, caching, or predictive scaling based on historical usage patterns.
- **Environmentally Sustainable Serverless Computing:** Analyze the environmental impact of serverless computing and propose strategies for optimizing resource utilization and reducing energy consumption in serverless platforms.
