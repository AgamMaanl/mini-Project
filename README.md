reserarch paper on serverless computing
## ABSTRACT
This research paper explores serverless computing, where cloud providers manage servers, freeing developers. It analyzes Function as a Service (FaaS) and Backend as a Service (BaaS) paradigms, comparing their benefits and use cases. Advantages like reduced complexity and cost-effectiveness are discussed, alongside challenges such as security and vendor lock-in. The study aims to propose solutions for effective deployment and management of serverless architectures.
## Objective:
1. To explore and analyze various aspects of serverless computing, focusing on its architectural principles and practical applications. 
2. To Understand and Explore the fundamental components of Serverless Architecture including its principles, Identify scalability benefit. 
3. To Examine current trends, Review and synthesize existing literature.
